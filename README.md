# Highschool-Computer-Certificate

A website I created, describing my Volunteering Club's activity in the 4 years I have activated in it. 
It's implemented in HTML+CSS, a bit of JavaScript, and the content is in Romanian.

The website has a main page ("Acasă") with some general information about our club, together with a portfolio of projects("Proiecte"), a section for interesting stuff about our organisational culture("Curiozități"), and some representative photos(Galerie Foto).

Each project described in the main page has a separate link for more details about each of them, accessible by double clicking on the respective photos.

_PS: Due to the corruption of a disk where this Certificate was stored, there are some photos which seem to be incomplete, but I am actively working on recovering them._
